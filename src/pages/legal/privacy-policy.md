**5\. Collection of information by third parties**

This site may contain links to websites or links operated by third parties. Those websites may have their own privacy policy or no policy at all. Leather Spa does not have any responsibility for those websites and the information practices of those websites are not covered by this privacy policy. In addition, a link to a third party website does not mean that Leather Spa endorses or accepts any responsibility for the content, or the use, of such website. It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select for your use is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature.

**6\. Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information which websites transfer to your computer’s web browser for storage on your computer’s hard drive. Leather Spa uses cookies to measure activity on our site, which allows us to improve navigation throughout our site. In addition, cookies on the site may contain information (such as an unique user id), which tracks the pages of the site you have visited. This information allows us to make updates to enhance your experience. Parts of the site will not function if you do not have cookies enabled. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you turn off cookies or refuse them, though, you will not be able to use every portion of our site. Please note that Leather Spa only collects aggregate information through cookies and does not collect any personally identifiable information through cookies.

**7\. Disclaimer of warranties**

The security of your personal information is important to us and Leather Spa is committed to handling your customer information carefully. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall Leather Spa or its affiliates be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages that result from the use of the information or materials on the site, even if Leather Spa or an authorized representative of Leather Spa has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages or implied warranties, the above limitations may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, Leather Spa’s liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

**8\. Business transfers**

In the event that Leather Spa sells substantially all of its assets, or one of Leather Spa’s business units are acquired, personally identifiable information of visitors to the site and aggregate information will likely be one of the transferred assets.

Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a visitor to our site is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files.
